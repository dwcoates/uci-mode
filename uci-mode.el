;;
;; Explanation
;;
;;     Uci-mode is a comint-derived major-mode for interacting directly with
;;     a UCI chess engine.  Direct UCI interaction is interesting for
;;     programmers who are developing chess engines, or advanced players who
;;     are doing deep analysis on games.  This mode is not useful for simply
;;     playing chess.
